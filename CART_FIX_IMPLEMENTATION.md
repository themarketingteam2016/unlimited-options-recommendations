# Cart-to-Checkout Fix Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Issue:** Cart shows base product price instead of custom variant price
**Solution:** Complete cart interceptor to use Draft Orders for checkout

---

## Problem Summary

The app creates 100+ custom variant combinations in the database, but Shopify only supports 100 variants per product. The previous "solution" was:

1. Store custom variants only in database
2. Add base variant to cart with `_Price` property
3. Use JavaScript to visually change displayed price
4. ❌ **Result:** Customer sees custom price but pays base price at checkout

**Root Cause:** Shopify line item properties are metadata only - they don't affect actual pricing.

---

## Solution Implemented

**Option 2: Complete Cart Interceptor** - Intercept checkout button and create Draft Order with correct pricing.

### Flow Diagram

```
Product Page → Add to Cart → Cart (visual price) → Click Checkout
                    ↓              ↓                      ↓
            Store variant ID   Show custom $   Intercept & create Draft Order
                    ↓              ↓                      ↓
            In properties      Via JS override    With correct pricing → Invoice
```

---

## Files Modified

### 1. **pages/api/cart/add-variant.js**

**Change:** Added `_custom_variant_id` to line item properties

**Location:** Line 109

```javascript
const properties = {
  '_Custom_Variant': 'Yes',
  '_Price': `$${variant.price}`,
  '_custom_variant_id': variant.id // Store variant ID for checkout
};
```

**Why:** The checkout interceptor needs the variant ID to create the Draft Order with correct items.

---

### 2. **shopify-theme-integration/cart-price-override.liquid**

#### Change A: Completed Checkout Interceptor

**Location:** Lines 156-222

**Before:**
```javascript
// TODO: Call your create-checkout API with all cart items
// For now, show a message
alert('Custom checkout flow coming soon!');
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Convert cart items to checkout format
const items = cart.items
  .filter(item => item.properties?._custom_variant_id)
  .map(item => ({
    variantId: item.properties._custom_variant_id,
    quantity: item.quantity
  }));

// Call create-checkout API
const response = await fetch(`${APP_URL}/api/cart/create-checkout`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ items })
});

const data = await response.json();
window.location.href = data.checkoutUrl;
```

**What it does:**
1. Extracts custom variant IDs from cart item properties
2. Calls `/api/cart/create-checkout` endpoint
3. Creates Shopify Draft Order with correct custom pricing
4. Redirects customer to Draft Order invoice URL
5. Customer completes payment with correct pricing ✅

#### Change B: Updated Checkout Message

**Location:** Lines 123-128

**Before:**
```html
<strong>⚠️ Custom Variants in Cart</strong><br>
Your cart contains custom configured items. Click "Checkout" to proceed with the correct pricing.
```

**After:**
```html
<strong>✨ Custom Configured Items</strong><br>
Your cart contains custom configured items with personalized pricing. Click "Checkout" to complete your order.
```

**Why:** More positive messaging, less alarming for customers.

## How to Test

### Test 1: Single Custom Variant

1. **Product Page:**
   - Go to a product with custom options
   - Select options (e.g., Metal: 14K Gold, Quality: VVS)
   - Click "Add to Cart" button
   - ✅ Item added to cart

2. **Cart Page:**
   - Open cart
   - ✅ Price shows custom amount (e.g., $2,499)
   - ✅ See "✨ Custom Configured Items" message
   - ✅ Options displayed as properties

3. **Checkout:**
   - Click "Checkout" button
   - ✅ Button changes to "Creating checkout..."
   - ✅ Redirected to Shopify Draft Order invoice
   - ✅ Invoice shows correct custom price
   - Complete test payment
   - ✅ Order created with correct pricing

### Test 2: Multiple Custom Variants

1. Add 2-3 different custom variants to cart
2. Verify each shows custom pricing in cart
3. Click "Checkout"
4. ✅ Draft Order contains all items with correct individual prices
5. ✅ Total is sum of all custom prices

### Test 3: Mixed Cart (Custom + Regular)

1. Add custom variant (with options)
2. Add regular Shopify variant (no custom options)
3. Cart should show both
4. Click "Checkout"
5. ✅ Only custom variants go through Draft Order flow
6. ⚠️ **Note:** This might need handling - regular items may be lost

### Test 4: Bundle with Recommendations

1. Select main product options
2. Check recommendation boxes
3. Click "Buy Now" (uses create-checkout directly)
4. ✅ Draft Order created with all items
5. ✅ Correct bundle pricing

## Browser Console Logs

When testing, watch browser console for these logs:

```
[Cart Price Override] Initializing...
[Cart Price Override] Cart data: {...}
[Cart Price Override] Found custom variant: {...}
[Cart Price Override] Redirecting to custom checkout...
[Cart Price Override] Creating checkout for items: [...]
[Cart Price Override] Checkout created, redirecting to: https://...
```

If errors occur:
```
[Cart Price Override] Checkout error: {...}
```

## API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/cart.js` | GET | Fetch cart data |
| `/cart/add.js` | POST | Add items to cart |
| `/api/cart/add-variant` | POST | Prepare custom variant for cart |
| `/api/cart/create-checkout` | POST | Create Draft Order for checkout |

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Mixed Cart Issue:** If cart has both custom variants and regular Shopify variants, only custom variants are sent to Draft Order. Regular items may be lost.

   **Workaround:** Keep custom and regular products separate, or handle all items via Draft Orders.

2. **No Discount Codes:** Shopify Draft Orders don't support automatic discount codes. Discounts must be applied manually in admin.

3. **Shopify Plus Features:** Cart Transform functions would be cleaner but require Shopify Plus plan.

---

## Deployment Steps

### Option A: Theme Files (Recommended)

1. Upload `cart-price-override.liquid` to your theme:
   ```
   Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes → Edit Code
   → Snippets → Upload cart-price-override.liquid
   ```

2. Add to your cart template:
   ```liquid
   {% render 'cart-price-override' %}
   ```

3. Save and test

### Option B: API Only

The API changes are already deployed if you push to Vercel:

```bash
git add pages/api/cart/add-variant.js
git commit -m "Fix: Store variant ID in cart properties for Draft Order checkout"
git push
```

Vercel will auto-deploy.

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Customer can add custom variant to cart
✅ Cart displays correct custom price
✅ Checkout button creates Draft Order
✅ Draft Order has correct pricing
✅ Customer completes payment successfully
✅ Order appears in Shopify admin with correct amount

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. Restore backups:
   ```bash
   cp backups/20251025_231556/* .
   ```

2. Or revert git commit:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push
   ```

3. Remove cart-price-override.liquid from theme

---

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Handle Mixed Carts:** Detect regular variants and include in Draft Order
2. **Clear Cart After Checkout:** Clear Shopify cart when redirecting to Draft Order
3. **Add Loading Spinner:** Show spinner instead of just text change
4. **Error Retry Logic:** Auto-retry failed checkout creation
5. **Analytics Tracking:** Track Draft Order conversions vs regular checkout

---

1. Check browser console for error logs
2. Check Vercel logs for API errors
3. Verify Draft Order appears in Shopify admin
4. Check webhook logs if stock not updating
